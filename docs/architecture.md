# Architecture

This document reflects the **actual current state** of the system, not the
target design. Update it as subsystems are completed — don't let it drift
into aspiration.

## Current status: Phase 1, RTOS running at 84 MHz (temporary blink test)

FreeRTOS builds, links and runs on the Nucleo at **84 MHz** (HSI + PLL): one
temporary task blinks the user LED (LD2 on PA5) from the scheduler. **Observed:
it blinks at about 1 s by eye; the period has not been measured with an
instrument yet** (no logic analyzer; to be checked on D13 later). Register
values and SysTick `LOAD = 83999` were checked in the debugger. There are no
sensor, UART or I2C drivers yet.

### Toolchain / project setup (done)

- Keil MDK-ARM project: `firmware/stm32-sensor-node/stm32-sensor-node.uvprojx`.
- Compiler: **Arm Compiler 6** (armclang V6.24).
- Single-precision FPU enabled in Target options (required by the
  `ARM_CM4F` port).
- Device support from the Keil STM32F4 DFP: `startup_stm32f411xe.s`,
  `system_stm32f4xx.c` (under `RTE/Device/STM32F411RETx/`).

### FreeRTOS kernel (V11.3.1): source integrated, configuration complete

```
firmware/stm32-sensor-node/FreeRTOS/
  event_groups.c list.c queue.c tasks.c timers.c   → group "FreeRTOS Core"
  include/                                          (vendor headers, unmodified)
  portable/GCC/ARM_CM4F/port.c, portmacro.h        → group "FreeRTOS Portable"
  config/FreeRTOSConfig.h                           → group "FreeRTOS Config"
```

- Include paths: `.\FreeRTOS\include`, `.\FreeRTOS\portable\GCC\ARM_CM4F`,
  `.\FreeRTOS\config`.
- **Port:** `GCC/ARM_CM4F`, not `RVDS/ARM_CM4F`. The RVDS port uses armcc
  embedded assembler, which Arm Compiler 6 doesn't support. See ADR-0002.
- **No `heap_x.c`** is compiled on purpose, so `pvPortMalloc()` does not exist.
- Vendor files (`include/`, `portable/`, core `.c` files) are kept
  unmodified. Project-specific configuration lives only in `config/`.

### `FreeRTOSConfig.h`: all sections complete

| Section | Status | Settings |
|---|---|---|
| Memory allocation model | ✅ done | `configSUPPORT_STATIC_ALLOCATION 1`, `configKERNEL_PROVIDED_STATIC_MEMORY 0`, `configSUPPORT_DYNAMIC_ALLOCATION 0`, `configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE 0` (ADR-0001) |
| Clock / tick | ✅ done | `configCPU_CLOCK_HZ (SystemCoreClock)`, `configTICK_RATE_HZ 1000`, `configUSE_PREEMPTION 1`, `configUSE_TIME_SLICING 1`, 32-bit tick (ADR-0003) |
| Tasks / stacks | ✅ done | `configMAX_PRIORITIES 3` (see task table below), `configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE 128` words, idle/tick hooks off, `configUSE_TIMERS 0`, CLZ task selection, stack overflow check method 2, high-water mark enabled |
| Interrupt priorities (NVIC/BASEPRI) | ✅ done | `configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY` = level 5 (raw `0x50`), via `configPRIO_BITS 4` + `configLIBRARY_MAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY 5` |
| `configASSERT` | ✅ done | disable interrupts (BASEPRI) + infinite loop; enables the port's priority and handler-installation checks |
| Port handler mapping (SVC/PendSV/SysTick → startup file names) | ✅ done | direct routing: `#define vPortSVCHandler SVC_Handler` etc. |
| Optional API functions | ✅ done | `INCLUDE_vTaskDelay 1`, `INCLUDE_xTaskDelayUntil 1` (others stay at default 0) |

### Application code (`firmware/stm32-sensor-node/Src/`)

- `main.c`: **temporary bring-up code.** `SystemCoreClockUpdate()`, PA5 set up
  at register level (GPIOA clock enable, read-modify-write on `MODER`), one
  blink task created with `xTaskCreateStatic()` (priority 1, static 128-word
  stack + TCB), toggling PA5 through `GPIOA->BSRR` every 500 ms with
  `vTaskDelayUntil()`. To be removed when the real sensor task exists.
  PA5 is also SPI1_SCK in the Phase 2 design.
- `freertos_callbacks.c`: `vApplicationGetIdleTaskMemory()` (static Idle TCB +
  stack sized with `configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE`) and
  `vApplicationStackOverflowHook()` (raise BASEPRI and loop forever).
- `clock.c` / `clock.h`: `clock_init_84mhz()` takes the CPU from the 16 MHz HSI
  to 84 MHz through the PLL (ADR-0006). Five steps in order: flash wait
  states (2) + prefetch + caches, bus prescalers (AHB /1, **APB1 /2 = 42 MHz**,
  APB2 /1), PLL numbers (M 8, N 168, P /4, source HSI), PLL on + bounded wait
  for `PLLRDY`, switch + bounded wait for `SWS`. Returns a status code and
  never hangs; on failure the CPU stays on the HSI. PLL limits are checked
  with `_Static_assert`. `main()` calls it before `SystemCoreClockUpdate()`.
- Footprint from the real Keil build (`Listings/stm32-sensor-node.map`): Code
  6756 B, RO data 472 B, RAM 3008 B of 128 KB (includes the 1 KB main stack
  and the 512 B C-library heap reserved by the startup file). **No `malloc`
  is linked** (confirmed in that map). Keil's static stack report gives 324 B
  for the start-up call chain on the main stack (interrupts not included).

### Drivers

The course/teacher drivers (ARM University Program, ST Standard Peripheral
Library, teacher-written I2C) are kept **locally only** in
`firmware/**/reference/` (git-ignored, outside the Keil project) as reading
material. GPIO, USART2 and I2C1 drivers will be written from scratch at
register level; the BMP280 maths will come from the author's own
`functions.c` after verification against the datasheet. (An ADR for this will
be written once the drivers exist.)

### Known gaps (real current state, not bugs)

- **Clock accuracy is that of the HSI (about 1%)**, and the true frequency has
  not been measured outside the chip. The timeout/error paths of
  `clock_init_84mhz()` have never been triggered. `SystemCoreClock` reports
  HCLK only: USART2 and I2C1 must use the 42 MHz APB1 clock.
- `vApplicationGetTimerTaskMemory()` is NOT needed (`configUSE_TIMERS 0`).
- Blink period not measured yet (no logic analyzer): the blink looks like 1 s
  by eye only.
- Measured stack peaks (ADR-0005): blink 27 words by the `0xA5` pattern; Idle
  at least 21 words actually written (the pattern said 14, but R4-R11 were
  saved with the fill value, so the pattern was forged by data). Both arrays
  are 128 words; `configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE` stays 128.
- The startup file reserves a 512-byte C-library heap that nothing uses;
  setting `Heap_Size` to 0 would reclaim it and make any accidental `malloc`
  fail loudly.
- No HardFault handler that exposes the stacked PC and fault registers.
- No USART2 debug output, no I2C1 driver, no BMP280 module.

### Architecture decisions so far

- ADR-0001: static-only memory allocation for FreeRTOS objects.
- ADR-0002: GCC/ARM_CM4F FreeRTOS port with Arm Compiler 6.
- ADR-0003: RTOS tick derived from `SystemCoreClock`, at 1 kHz.
- ADR-0004: interrupt priority threshold for FreeRTOS API calls at level 5.
- ADR-0005: task stacks sized by measurement with a margin; Idle stays at 128
  words.
- ADR-0006: CPU at 84 MHz from the HSI through the PLL, in its own module.

Below is the target shape for Phase 1, kept here as a near-term plan,
clearly marked as such.

```

- One FreeRTOS task reads the BMP280 over I2C1 (PB8/PB9) at a fixed
  interval.
- **Sensor: Bosch BMP280** (temperature + pressure; no humidity, unlike the
  BME280). Chip ID register `0xD0` reads `0x58`. I2C address `0x76` or
  `0x77` depending on the SDO pin.
- **Debug logging:** the sensor task prints readings directly over USART2
  (PA2 = TX, PA3 = RX), which the Nucleo's ST-LINK exposes as a virtual COM
  port. This is a blocking, debug-only aid for bring-up, not part of the
  data path (that is SPI + DMA). No dedicated logging task.
- No MPU-6050 IMU: it was dropped from the design.
- All RTOS objects (the task itself, any queue used to hand data off) are
  statically allocated.
- No SPI/DMA/gateway work yet — that's Phase 2.

### Task set and priorities (decided)

Task priority: higher number = more urgent. `configMAX_PRIORITIES = 3`.

| Priority | Task | Phase | Why this level |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | Transmit task (SPI + DMA to the Pi) | 2 (not written) | The Pi is the SPI master and clocks data out when it decides, so the deadline is imposed from outside. |
| 1 | Sensor task (BMP280 over I2C1, plus debug prints) | 1 (not written) | Period chosen by us; a few ms of lateness is harmless. |
| 0 | Idle | kernel | Runs when nothing else is ready. |

Interrupt levels are a separate system (lower number = more urgent): ISRs
that call `...FromISR()` functions must be at level 5 or a larger number.

## Open questions / not yet decided

- Exact sensor read interval.
- Whether raw or calibration-compensated BMP280 values are computed
  on-device vs. passed through raw (compensation requires the factory
  trimming parameters stored in the sensor's NVM — see BMP280 datasheet
  §3.11.2 "Trimming parameter readout" and §3.11.3 "Compensation formula").
- Whether a queue is used to hand data from the sensor task to a
  (currently nonexistent) transmit task, or whether Phase 1 is entirely
  self-contained and just gets a value into a global static buffer to make
  the RTOS/I2C interaction real first.

## Change log

- 2026-09-27: Document created. No implementation yet.
- 2026-09-28: FreeRTOS V11.3.1 source added to the Keil project.
  `FreeRTOSConfig.h` created in `FreeRTOS/config/` with the memory
  allocation section (ADR-0001).
- 2026-09-29: FreeRTOS port switched from `RVDS/ARM_CM4F` to
  `GCC/ARM_CM4F` for Arm Compiler 6 compatibility (ADR-0002).
- 2026-09-29: `FreeRTOSConfig.h` clock/tick section: tick derived from
  CMSIS `SystemCoreClock` (correct on 16 MHz HSI today and after the future
  84 MHz PLL setup), 1 kHz tick. `main()` must run clock setup ->
  `SystemCoreClockUpdate()` -> `vTaskStartScheduler()` in that order.
- 2026-09-30: `FreeRTOSConfig.h` completed: tasks/stacks, interrupt
  priorities (threshold level 5), `configASSERT`, handler mapping,
  `INCLUDE_` settings, `configMAX_PRIORITIES 3`.
- 2026-09-30: Design decisions: sensor is the BMP280 (not BME280); the
  MPU-6050 IMU is dropped; debug logging over USART2 directly from the
  sensor task; task set and priorities fixed (table above).
- 2026-10-02: First application code: `Src/main.c` (temporary PA5 blink task)
  and `Src/freertos_callbacks.c`. The kernel builds and links; the blink runs
  on the board (period not yet measured). Teacher/course drivers moved to a
  git-ignored `reference/` folder; own register-level drivers planned.
- 2026-10-03: Stack usage measured with the `0xA5` pattern in the debugger
  (blink 27 words; Idle at least 21 words once cross-checked against the
  17-word context size). Recorded as ADR-0005. Real Keil `.map` checked: no
  `malloc`, Code 6200 B, RAM 3000 B.
- 2026-10-03: `Src/clock.c` added: the CPU now runs at 84 MHz from the HSI
  through the PLL, written and checked one step at a time on the board
  (flash wait states, bus prescalers, PLL numbers, PLL start, switch).
  Recorded as ADR-0006.
